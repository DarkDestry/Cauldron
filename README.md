## Introduction

Cauldron is an editor intended to be used with [Elixir](https://github.com/Eclmist/Elixir). 

The Cauldron project started with the need of a scene editor for a headless renderer. It is intended to be an experiment and learning experience for building a editor from the ground up. 

SharpGL is used as an temporary renderer as a separate DX12 renderer is being built.

## Built With

* [Windows Presentation Foundation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/) - The Framework used for the UI
* [SharpGL](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpgl/wiki) - Temporary Raster Renderer for scene rendering
* [Ether](https://github.com/Eclmist/Ether) - DX12 Raster Renderer for scene rendering
